This is a placeholder for the 1992 Constitution of Ghana.
In a real deployment, this would be the full text or PDF of the constitution.
Article 1: The Sovereignty of Ghana resides in the people of Ghana in whose name and for whose welfare the powers of government are to be exercised in the manner and within the limits laid down in this Constitution.
Article 2: This Constitution shall be the supreme law of Ghana and any other law found to be inconsistent with any provision of this Constitution shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be void.
